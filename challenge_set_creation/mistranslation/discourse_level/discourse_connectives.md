### Discourse Connectives

**Construction:** Manual

**Aim:** Construct examples where there is ambiguity as to the sense of "tandis que" or "alors que" in the French source
sentence (both of which, like English "while" can have either a Comparison.Contrast or Temporal.Synchrony sense).

**Note:** We used a parallel corpus of English-French, annotated for discourse connectives. The following instructions may
be applied to other similarly annotated corpora, and for different languages (for different connectives / translations).

**Instructions:**
1. Select French source sentences containing an instance of "tandis que" or "alors que" with a Comparison.Contrast or
Temporal.Synchrony sense, where the English reference contains "while" as its translation.
2. Construct the "good" translation by replacing instances of "while" temporal with "as" or "as long as" / instances of
"while" comparison as "whereas" (ensuring grammaticality is preserved).
3. Construct the "incorrect" translation by replacing the English discourse connective with one of the alternative
senses of "while" e.g. use "whereas" (comparison) where a temporal sense is required.

**Example:**

>**SRC (fr):** Dans l’UE-10, elles ont progressé de 8% tandis que la dette pour l’UE-2 a augmenté de 152%.

>**REF (en):** In EU-10 they grew by 8% while the debt for the EU-2 increased by 152%.

>**good:** In the EU-10, they increased by 8% when the debt for the EU-2 increased by 152%.

>**incorrect:** In the EU-10, they increased by 8% whereas the debt for the EU-2 increased by 152%.
