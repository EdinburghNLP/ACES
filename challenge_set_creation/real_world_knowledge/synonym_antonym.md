###Synonym-antonym [VERBS]:

**Construction:** Manual

**Aim:** Construct examples where the verb in the good translation is a synonym of the verb in the reference, and the
verb in the incorrect translation is an antonym.

**Instructions:**

1. Identify verb triples of the form ("s1", "s2", "a") where "s1" and "s2" are synonyms (of each other) and "a" is an
antonym of both "s1" and "s2". E.g. ("hate", "loathe", "love").
2. Identify a source sentence S and a reference translation R where R contains an instance of "s1".
3. Construct the "good" translation: copy R and replace the instance of "s1" with "s2"
(e.g. replace "hate" with "loathe").
4. Construct the "incorrect" translation: copy R and replace the instance "s1" with "a"
(e.g. replace "hate" with "love").

**Example:**

>**SRC (de):** Ich hasste jedes StÃ¼ck der Schule!

>**REF (en):** I hated every bit of school!

>**good:** I loathed every bit of school!

>**incorrect:** I loved every bit of school!
