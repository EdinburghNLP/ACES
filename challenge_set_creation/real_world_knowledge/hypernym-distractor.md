###Hypernym-distractor [NOUNS]:

**Construction:** Manual

**Aim:** Construct examples where the noun in the good translation is a hypernym of the noun in the reference, and the
noun in the incorrect translation is a distractor (i.e. another noun belonging to the same "class").

**Instructions:**

1. Identify noun triples of the form ("n-hyper", "n", "n-distract") where "n-hyper" is a hypernym of "n" (e.g. "n":"dog",
"n-hyper":"pet" - dog belongs to the pet class) and "n-distract" is a distractor, a member of the same class
(e.g. "n-distract":"cat" - cat also belongs to the pet class).
2. Identify a source sentence S and a reference translation R where R contains an instance of "n".
3. Construct the "good" translation: copy R and replace the instance of "n" with "n-hyper"
(e.g. replace "dog" with "pet").
4. Construct the "incorrect" translation: copy R and replace the instance "n" with "n-distract"
(e.g. replace "dog" with "cat").

**Example:**

>**SRC (de):** ..., dass der Hund meiner Schwester gehÃ¶rt.

>**REF (en):** ... the dog belonged to my sister.

>**good:** ... the pet belonged to my sister.

>**incorrect:** ... the cat belonged to my sister.
